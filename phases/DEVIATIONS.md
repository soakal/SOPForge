# Deviations

## UIPI

**Acceptance criterion 6** (phases/01-capture.md): "Hotkey start/stop works
while an elevated window has focus, or the limitation is documented in
DEVIATIONS.md with the UIPI explanation."

This could not be verified with a genuinely elevated window in the autonomous
build environment: this process is not elevated, and there is no way to
obtain a real elevated process non-interactively. `ShellExecuteW(...,
"runas", ...)` requires interactive UAC consent (no user is present in this
autonomous, no-user-contact build loop), and the alternative — a scheduled
task configured to run with highest privileges, which Task Scheduler can
launch without a UAC prompt — requires modifying scheduled tasks, which
CLAUDE.md's global rules require explicit user confirmation for.

**What is actually expected to happen, architecturally:** `src/capture/
hooks.py`'s `InputRecorder` uses pynput's `WH_MOUSE_LL`/`WH_KEYBOARD_LL`
global low-level hooks. Windows' UIPI (User Interface Privilege Isolation)
deliberately filters low-level hook callbacks installed by a *lower*-integrity
process while a *higher*-integrity (elevated) window has focus — this is a
documented anti-keylogger hardening added after Vista's UIPI introduction,
and is exactly why tools like AutoHotkey need to run elevated (or ship a
signed `uiAccess=true` manifest) for their hotkeys to fire over admin
windows. So the *expected* real-world behavior is that `sopforge.exe`'s
capture hotkey silently stops firing while focus is on an elevated window,
unless `sopforge.exe` itself is also running elevated. This is the
limitation criterion 6 anticipates, not a bug to chase later — if it's ever
a real problem for users, the fix is running the capture agent elevated (or
a uiAccess manifest), not touching hooks.py's hook-installation logic.

**Separately, and independent of elevation:** this build VM's synthetic input
injection (pynput's Controller, and a raw ctypes `SendInput` bypassing pynput
entirely) has been observed to *intermittently* fail with
`GetLastError() == ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED (5)` and intermittently succeed, with
no code change, across this same session (mirrors an identical intermittency
finding for real GDI screen capture — see .claude/skills/uia-notes.md). This
script probes it live on every run rather than trusting a cached result from
a prior run, and records what it observed this time — see the script's
printed output for this run's actual reading.
